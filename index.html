        What is digital? It is abstract. The digital environment is mainly expressed in two ways. The first is described as a pixelated object or something composed of binary code. It might reflect the computer's screen and electronic signal as a result of people's imagination of how digital looks. Second, it is depicted as a photorealistic object expressed with advanced rendering technology. We can easily see CGs like fire, lightning, and storm in movies. The advanced rendering technology in digital materiality forms realistic virtual reality. It seems to simply represent duplicated reality, but I believe it depicts more than that. The fire in the movie is more dramatic than the actual fire. The fire in the movie is more dramatic than the actual fire. It is because digital objects include our fantasies or expectations of digital.
        <br><br>I believe that our imagination and expectations about the digital environment define and strengthen digital materiality through the two cases. Moreover, our imaginations and expectations materialize and develop the future. There may soon be flying cars or spacecraft in the future. Let's build a future spaceship with digital materiality.
